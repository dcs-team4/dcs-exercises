# DCS Team 4 Exercises

Repository for code related to exercises in _Design of Communicating Systems_.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/dcs-team4/dcs-exercises.git
```

2. Navigate to the right folder:

```
cd dcs-exercises
```

3. Verify your Python installation:

```
python3 --version
```

Output should be `Python 3.x.x` (ideally 3.10+). If not, get the latest version here:<br>https://www.python.org/downloads/

4. Install project dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Open the notebooks (`.ipynb` files) in VSCode, or your favorite Jupyter notebook editor.

## VSCode Setup

1. Install VSCode<br>https://code.visualstudio.com/

2. Install Python extension (includes Jupyter)<br>https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python

3. Install Live Share extension<br>https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare

4. Log in to VSCode with GitHub (bottom left corner of VSCode window)

Now you should be able to open Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files), run code within them (assuming you have already done `pip install notebook`) and join Live Share sessions for collaborative coding.
